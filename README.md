Project Title : Student Information System

Description:

The Student Information System (SIS) is a Java-based application designed to manage information related to students, their enrolled courses, academic records, and administrative details. This system provides a comprehensive framework for organizing and retrieving data, facilitating effective student administration within an educational institution.

Key Features:

Student Management:

Student Information: Captures essential details such as student ID, first name, last name, and enrollment status.
Course Enrollment: Allows students to enroll in multiple courses, creating a dynamic record of their academic pursuits.
Academic Records:

Course Grades: Records and maintains academic performance through a structured system of courses and grades.
Record Addition: Enables the addition of academic records for each enrolled course, providing a comprehensive overview of a student's achievements.
Administrative Information:

Contact Information: Stores administrative details, including contact numbers and addresses, facilitating communication between the educational institution and the student.
User-Friendly Display: Presents administrative information in an easily readable format within the student's profile.
Course Management:

Course Information: Stores details about each course, including a unique course code and a descriptive course name.
Enrollment Tracking: Tracks the courses in which each student is enrolled, creating a transparent record of academic pursuits.
Search and Retrieval:

Student Lookup: Implements a student search functionality by student ID, allowing quick retrieval of student information.
Dynamic Display: Displays a student's information dynamically, providing a snapshot of their academic journey.
Object-Oriented Design:

Class Structure: Adopts an object-oriented design with classes such as Student, Course, AcademicRecord, and AdministrativeInfo to enhance code modularity and maintainability.
Encapsulation: Encapsulates related attributes and behaviors within each class, promoting clean code organization.
User Interaction:

Scanner Input: Utilizes the Scanner class for user input, making it easy to interactively search for student information.
Informative Output: Presents detailed information about a student's enrolled courses, academic records, and administrative details.
Data Storage:

List Implementation: Utilizes ArrayList to efficiently manage lists of students, courses, academic records, and administrative information.
Data Organization: Structurally organizes data to provide a clear representation of student and course-related information.
System Extensibility:

Addition of Students: Supports the addition of new students to the system dynamically, accommodating future enrollment.
Scalability: Easily scalable to include additional features such as performance analytics, course statistics, and user authentication.
Educational Utility:

Academic Focus: Tailored for educational institutions to manage student academic information effectively.
Transparency: Offers transparency into a student's academic journey, supporting educators and administrators in decision-making.
